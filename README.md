# CREATING DASHBOARDS USING ADVANCED EXCEL

## Project 1
<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6qOL69bIQz8/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Alt text"> **[Call center Data Analysis-creating a dashboard with excel](https://github.com/nav-kumar/Data-Analyst-Projects/tree/c13c2259c23f52fffaf6e89315c560ba02922d62/Excel%20Dashboard%20Project)**
In this project, i have created a dashboard using Microsoft Excel successfully. iVision is a well-known analytics firm. iVision does analytics on the data shared by their clients. Recently, iVision collaborated with Nile, an E-commerce company. Nile intends to improve their customer service, but before doing so, Nile wants to get some insights on their customer service request data. To help Nile make better business decisions and improve their services, iVision is engaged to provide Nile access to the analytics dashboard and report. Nile has shared its customer service data with iVision. I have assumed myself as an employee of iVision for creating this analytics report.

The dashboard gives you a perfect analysis of customer service data which i have analysed by performing various operations in excel right from creating charts, graphs, pivot tables, conditional formatting, data cleaning, removong duplicte data, handling missing values from the given data, performing data type changing operations.

Follwing are the goals for the project that i have to perfrom to showcase them in final dashboard::1) Customer semtiment analysis 2) Root cause analysis 3) Identification of trends and patterns 4) Customer segmentation 5) Service response time analyis

To create my dashboard, i have to handle missing values in my dataset. here are all the columns that i have in my dataset::1)id 2)customer_name 3)sentiment 4)csat_score 5)call_timestamp 6)reason 7)city 8)state 9)channel 10)response_time 11)call duration in minutes 12)call_center. 

There are so many missing values in csat_score column for which i have used various imputation techniques using python and statistical methods to fill those missing values and performed data analysis to create dashboard. I have used statistical methods such as Mean, Median and mode to fill missing values along with various Machine learning techniques using python such as KNN Imputation, Regression, Random forest algorithms to fill those missing values and created seperate dashboard for each and every scenario including a case where i have created a dashboard without consdering the column of csat_Score for data analysis.

I have created a Dashborad based on huge datasets of Airbnb Listings and Reviews. The dataset has two dimensions: The Reviews dataset contains information about reviews left for Airbnb listings, while the Listings dataset contains all relevant details about the listed stays.

The primary objective is to analyze Airbnb data to reveal insights into user experiences and satisfaction levels with the numerous listed stays, all accomplished using Power BI.

Here are the goals i have set for the dashboard. Assessing most favourite places to visit based on popularity score, Analyzing composite scores, visualizing Airbnb Listings and prices, Assessing district location scores, Property type price analysis, Analyzing amenities provided based on property and room type, Review scores and many comprehensive insights that can be derived from Airbnb's dataset.

This dashboard involved creating many DAX functions to analyze the data and plot the insights such as composite score, district location score, avg review score, avg host acceptance rate, avg host response rate, amenity count, booking frequency, host tenure, visitors, popularity score, review count, day of the week.

Different data visualization techniques like line charts, bar charts, bubble charts, tree maps, scatter plots, heat maps, Word Cloud, cards, column charts along with traditional tabular data and slicers were used to visualize. The data was sourced from Airbnb's API. The data was then transformed and modeled using DAX. Here is the link for dashboard along with PDF, PPT

Checkout my new Dashboard which is based on IPL(Indian Premier League) (matches and ball_by_ball) datastets spanning from 2008 to 2022.

The datasets were first imported to Microsoft SQL Server Management studio and then connected it though PowerBI Desktop. The dashboard uses the data from SQL Server, the data was cleaned to perform analysis, data manipulation and various measures were created using DAX functions, Calendar table. The preprocessed and manipulated data was used for developing appropriate visualizations in dashboard.

1) The dashboard gives you in-depth analysis on the IPL matches that have been played from 2008 to 2022.
2) Selecting a particular year gives you a summary of title winner, orange cap holder, purple cap holder, tournament 6's, tournament 4's( which also vary when you select a particular player)
3) IPL batting and bowling statistics of all the players who have played in IPL from 2008 to 2022 are displayed by selecting a particular player and they also vary in connection with the year.
4) when you select a player for batting statistics, his total runs, 6's, 4's and Strike rate for all the years are displayed, where as when you select a bowler for stats, his total wickets along with his economy, average and bowling strike rate are displayed accordingly and also varies as per year.
5) As we know toss plays a crucial role in IPL, i have created a donut chart which shows percentages of matches won on the basis of toss, percentages of matches won on the basis of result type(by wickets, by runs, super over).
6) Another data visualization is a bar chart which shows the matches won by venue which also varies according to result type, total number of matches won by team in the entire span has been created and it also varies according to the year.

# 1. IBM Data Science Capstone Project - SpaceX Falcon9

## Introduction
<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://w0.peakpx.com/wallpaper/47/792/HD-wallpaper-spacex-falcon-9-rocket-space-stars.jpg" alt="Alt text"> **[SpaceX Falcon9 Launch]**
In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 

This capstone project course will give you a taste of what data scientists go through in real life when working with real datasets. You will assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving [data collection], [data wrangling], [exploratory data analysis], [data visualization], [model development], [model evaluation], and [reporting](https://github.com/nav-kumar/Learning/blob/92f69bfc5b0c2fbfe0b77ffc4f249e6cef815a9a/SpaceX%20Final%20Project%20Presentation.pdf) your results to stakeholders. You are tasked with predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. 

## Business Problem
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if you can accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, you can determine the cost of a launch. With the help of your Data Science findings and models, the competing startup you have been hired by can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 

## Objective
- To apply data science toolkit and machine learning in order to accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, and thus determine the cost of a launch.
- Explore the data in order to obtain more insight from the data.
